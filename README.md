    <p>3.	Now if youâ€™re running a realm set isRealm to true and enter the invite code, if you have a hosted bedrock dedicated server keep this set to false and follow step 4</p>
     <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jsRDLKl.png"style="width:400px;height:100px;">
    <p>4. For BDS servers you need to enter the IP address and Port number so the script can connect for example</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/znIGYEl.png"style="width:400px;height:100px;">
    <p>5.	Guild this is the id of the discord server you can find this by right clicking on the server in discord and clicking on copy id. Paste this into the guild field in the config file</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tD7lMZk.png"style="width:200px;height:200px;">
    <p>6. The channel is the main channel you to be used with the chat relay between Discord and Minecraft, simply grab the ID by right clicking on the channel in discord and click on copy ID paste this into the file under channel as you have done before</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ozvja0y.png"style="width:500px;height:100px;">
    <p>7.	Next is getting a second channel setup for logging the anticheat while this is focused on Paradox it will have basic support for others as the project is open source you can fork the repository and add anything that is required, to log to a different channel enabled paradoxLogs</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1GHzZuM.png"style="width:500px;height:100px;">
    <p>8.	CmdPrefix this is designed for paradox as you can change the command prefix in game, the default is set this will allow you to run commands like `!ban Pete9xi was spamming chat`, This can be changed to use with other anti cheats that support chat commands in game.</p>
    <p>9.	The on join player message is handled via a packet that will grab the relevant information this will include the players name as well as the device they are connecting with, in the event that a server fails to broadcast this as a backup you can enabled useSystemPlayerJoinMessage this will use the yellow message in game when a player joins and will send this back to discord</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rkr5OcE.png"style="width:500px;height:50px;">
    <p>10. Embeds, the script is designed to send embeds back to discord, if enabled you can set the name as well as the colour via the settings below to enable them make sure you have useEmbed set to true and example can be seen below, the colour values are Red,Green,Blue (RBG). For eample Red = 255,0,0 </p>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ATbW5EB.png"style="width:500px;height:100px;">  
  <p> 12.	Admins, this controls who can run commands via discord when you send a command like !version it will check to make sure the user id is on the list in config.json if so it will allow the command to be sent to the server/realm if not it will be blocked. Right click your username and click on copy id. You can add multiple accounts see the example below <strong>Leave authType set to false at all times this means it will authenticate via xbox live only.</strong> </p>
